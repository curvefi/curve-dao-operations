# Curve DAO Operations

This repository contains tools, written in python, for Curve DAO operations. The goal is to provide a simple command-line interface that allows veCRV holders to create and decode on-chain executable proposals, and simple scripts to produce analytics on governance in the Curve DAO.

Such a CLI tool allows independence from a web-ui: after all, decentralisation goes beyond just network decentralisation: it more or less means democratic access to technology.

# Who needs this?

veCRV holders looking to create on-chain proposals such as

- Creating or killing Curve DAO gauges that reward CRV inflation to addresses (liquidity pools or otherwise).
- Creating a smartwallet whitelist to lock veCRV (veCRV restricts smart contracts to lock CRV, subject to a DAO whitelist vote)
- Changing liquidity pool parameters
- Adding gauge types ...
- ... etc.

Curve DAO stakeholders have the ability to change the protocol in many ways. This repository is an attempt to consolidate all on-chain DAO operations into a single tool.

# Setup

## Environment Variables

Please setup access to IPFS using Infura at: [https://infura.io/](https://infura.io/)

1. `IPFS_PROJECT_ID`
2. `IPFS_PROJECT_SECRET`

Please setup access to Ethereum via Alchemy here: [https://www.alchemy.com/](https://www.alchemy.com/)

1. `WEB3_ALCHEMY_API_KEY`

If you're a power user that wants to use your own node, you'll need to setup `ape-config.yaml`:

```
hardhat:
  port: auto
  fork:
    ethereum:
      mainnet:
        upstream_provider: geth

geth:
  ethereum:
    mainnet:
      uri: <node url, e.g. http://localhost:9090>
```

## Installing the tool

The following is sufficient for installing all the dependencies (except one):

```
> python -m venv venv
> source ./venv/bin/activate
> pip install --upgrade pip
> pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

The `ape-hardhat` plugin also requires `hardhat`, which should be npm installed using the `package-lock.json`:

```
npm install
```


# Available tools

Currently, the DAO operations tool grants the following:

#### `decode_executable`

This is a read-only tool that allows access to all users (they don't need to be a Curve Finance stakeholder) to decode an on-chain proposal.

| Input       | Type   | Description                                |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `vote_type` | `str`  | The type of vote (ownership or parameter). |
| `vote_id`   | `int`  | The vote ID of an on-chain proposal.       |

An example of its usage is showed in the following:

```shell
$ ape run decode_executable decode --vote-type ownership --vote-id 223
```

Output:

```shell

#### `execute_vote`

This tool allows users to execute passed Curve DAO votes. A guide on adding an account to sign transactions using Ape can be found [here](https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/userguides/accounts.html#live-network-accounts).


| Input       | Type   | Description                                |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `vote_type` | `str`  | The type of vote (ownership or parameter). |
| `vote_id`   | `int`  | The vote ID of an on-chain proposal.       |
| `simulate`  | `bool` | Whether to simulate the execution or not. This input is optional; if no input is given, it defaults to `True`. |


An example of its usage is showed in the following:

```shell
$ ape run execute_vote execute --vote-type ownership --vote-id 515 --simulate True
```


# How to contribute:

The goal is to cover all DAO operations in CLI tools. All utility scripts go to: `scripts/utils`, and all CLI tools are stored in the `scripts` folder.

## Pre-commit

For linting, the repo uses pre-commit hooks. Please install and use them via:

```
> pre-commit install
> pre-commit run --all-files
```

In order to contribute, please fork off of the `main` branch and make your changes there. Your commit messages should detail why you made your change in addition to what you did (unless it is a tiny change).

If you need to pull in any changes from `main` after making your fork (for example, to resolve potential merge conflicts), please avoid using `git merge` and instead, `git rebase` your branch

Please also include sufficient test cases, and sufficient docstrings. All tests must pass before a pull request can be accepted into `main`.
